		span designers 
		| and 
		span developers 
		| helping them learn and achieve thier goals.

	p During the day I teach UX and Web Technologies at FullSail University. I have been desinging and bringing experiences to life on the web for over 15 years now. Between my teaching on campus and what I've learned over the years I started Code is an Artform to share my knowledge with others. I hustle  to transform my creative visions into beautiful interactive products.
