<section id="about"> <h2>I spend my time mentoring <span>designers </span>and <span>developers </span>helping them learn and achieve thier goals.</h2><p>During the day I teach UX and Web Technologies at FullSail University. I have been desinging and bringing experiences to life on the web for over 15 years now. Between my teaching on campus and what I've learned over the years I started Code is an Artform to share my knowledge with others. I hustle  to transform my creative visions into beautiful interactive products.</p></section>
